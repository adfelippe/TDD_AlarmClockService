### TDD Led Driver

This is an Alarm Clock Service project developed using TDD.
It's the resolution to the task 2 (Put the Knowledge to Work) proposed in chapter 12 from James W. Grenning's Test-Driven Development for Embedded C.

The only difference is that this test uses ceedling instead of plain unity or CppUTest.
Firstly install ceedling and then run `ceedling` to run all the tests.
Ceedling has plenty of documentation around, so be happy! :)
